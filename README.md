    <ul>
        <li>The code and logic were lengthy.</li>
        <li>The code was DRY but can be clean and reduced more.</li>
        <li>We can use more Laravel features like custom requests to don't have to check null values again.</li>
        <li>In this code there were a few things that needed to be fixed according to MVC concepts, there was a repository for booking but still, in the controller, there were tasks other than service handled as well, I think this is not a good practice.</li>
    </ul>
