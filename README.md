<p>
The code and logic were lengthy.
The code was DRY but can be clean and reduced more.
We can use more Laravel features like custom requests to don't have to check null values again.
In this code there were a few things that needed to be fixed according to MVC concepts, there was a repository for booking but still, in the controller, there were tasks other than service handled as well, I think this is not a good practice.
